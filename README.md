# 🚀 Productionizing a Microservices Application (Reverse-Engineered)

> [!NOTE]
> This project is based on an existing application that I reverse-engineered and enhanced → [(original repo)](https://github.com/aws-containers/retail-store-sample-app).

> [!NOTE]
> Beyond this implementation, the Application layer of the project was deployed on AWS EKS Auto Mode, Terraform-provisioned infrastructure, and full ArgoCD-driven GitOps CI/CD workflows → [(View Implementation)](https://github.com/sonuparit/terraform-gitops-pipeline).

This project focuses on reverse engineering and productionizing a distributed microservices application using Kubernetes, GitOps, observability tooling, and cloud-native operational practices.

The implementation emphasizes real-world DevOps engineering challenges including multi-environment deployments, stateful workloads, secret management, deployment orchestration, monitoring, alerting, and production-grade operational workflows.
